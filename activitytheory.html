			<h3><a href="/">&laquo; back to HCI theory is your new bicycle</a></h3>

			<h1>HCI theory helps us see the big picture.</h1>

			<p>There are 4 tenets of Activity Theory:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>An emphasis on human intentionality. Just like things are designed with intention, we act with intention.</li>
				<li>The asymmetry of people and things. People are different than technology.</li>
				<li>The importance of human development. It&apos;s not just how we use the system now, it&apos;s how we use it later, too.</li>
				<li>The idea of culture and society as shaping human activity. It&apos;s not just outside us, impacting us. It defines us.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>And there are 3 benefits to using these tenets:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Provides a matrix on which to reflect on our practice. Join multiple dissimilar theories into cohesive one.</li>
				<li>Frame discussion of users&apos; continuing frustrations. Takes into account human development.</li>
				<li>Reckoning with the long-term impacts of design. Consider wider impact, such as impact of batteries on environment.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<p>&ldquo;Activity theory is not a &ldquo;theory&rdquo; in the traditional sense in which &ldquo;theory&rdquo; is understood in natural sciences. Activity theory does not support creating and running predictive models which would only need to be &ldquo;fed&rdquo; with appropriate data. Instead, it aims to help researchers and practitioners to orientate themselves in complex real-life problems, identify key issues which need to be dealt with, and direct the search for relevant evidence and suitable solutions. In other words, the key advantage of activity theory appears to be in supporting researchers and practitioners in their own inquiry &ndash; for instance, by helping to ask right questions &ndash; rather than providing ready-made answers&rdquo; <a href="references.html">(Kaptelinin, 2013). </a> </p>

			<h2>Important thinkers</h2>

			<h3>Primary thinkers</h3>
			<p>&ldquo;The first articulate and systematic attempt to introduce activity theory as a theoretical foundation for human-computer interaction was made by Susanne B&oslash;dker, a Danish scientist and a key figure in the participatory design community. In 1982-1983, when human-computer interaction was emerging as a new research field based on information processing psychology, B&oslash;dker was a visiting reacher at Xerox PARC <a href="references.html">(Bharadwaj, Lee, Pledger, & V, 2013)</a> At a time when most researchers were still enthusiastic about the prospects for cognitive psychology as the foundation for HCI, B&oslash;dker&apos;s participatory design background made her aware of the limitations of focusing exclusively on the information-processing aspects of human-computer interaction. Several years later, in her PhD thesis, <em>Through the Interface: A Human Activity Approach to User Interface Design</em>, she made the case for activity theory. The thesis was summarized in a journal paper and later published as a book. B&oslash;dker proposed activity theory &ldquo;as a theoretical foundation for HCI. The main idea was the need to consider the human use of technology within the wider context of human interaction with the world: an interaction mediated by technology&rdquo; <a href="references.html">(Kaptelinin & Nardi, 2006)</a>. Susanne B&oslash;dker is currently professor of Human Computer Interaction at the Computer Science Department, University of Aarhus.</p>

			<p>Yrg&ouml; Engestr&ouml;m applied the ideas from Activity Theory into learning, and created the theory of Expansive learning. Expansive learning is &ldquo;...learning in which the learners are involved in constructing and implementing a radically new, wider and more complex object and concept for their activity&rdquo;. The theory of expansive learning contributes to the focus of context-based design, or the understanding of what users actually do and not just what they are assumed to do. Engestr&ouml;m is currently a professor of Adult Education and Director of the Center for Research on Activity, Development and learning (CRADLE) at the University of Helsinki and is also a professor of Communication at the University of California, San Diego. <a href="references.html">(Easterwood, Perez, Plank, & Ramirez, 2013)</a>.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the most ardent and longstanding proponents are Bonnie Nardi and Victor Kaptelinin. Since the mid 1990s, they have tirelessly promoted the AT approach, arguing that it has much to offer HCI researchers and practitioners, especially compared with other cognitive and social approaches that have been imported into the field (Nardi and Kaptelinin, 2012). They claim it provides &ldquo;the rigor and dedication of the scientific method of traditional cognitive science with the much needed attention to social and contextual factors necessary to HCI studies&rdquo; <a href="references.html">(Kaptelinin & Nardi, 1997) </a>. Part of their mission has been to provide a broad framework for describing the structure, development and context of computer-supported activities that is easily usable by practitioners. This has included giving tutorials, workshops and an Activity checklist for identifying the most important factors influencing the use of computer technologies in a particular setting <a href="references.html">(Kaptelinin et al., 1999)</a>&rdquo; <a href="references.html">(Rogers, 2012)</a>. Victor Kaptelinin is a Professor at the Department of Information Science and Media Studies, University of Bergen, Norway, and the Department of Informatics, Ume&aring; University, Sweden. Bonnie Nardi is a Professor in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.</p>

			<h3>Secondary thinkers</h3>
			<p>"Terry Allen Winograd is currently Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at Stanford University. He has been at Stanford since 1973, beginning his academic career focused on artificial intelligence and natural language, programming computers to interact with and imitate people. Winograd moved away from AI and natural language as he began to understand that the fundamental goal is to create computer interactions that support and enhance human experience" <a href="references.htm">(Addepalli, Foshee, Oldham, & Xue, 2013)</a>, and advanced our understanding and application of Activity Theory. He then founded the influential Stanford Human-Computer Interaction Group where he still directs HCI research and teaching programs. His noted past students at Stanford include Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google.</p>

			<p>Yvonne Rogers is one of the authors of the definitive textbook on Interaction Design and HCI, which includes detailed treatment of Activity Theory.</p>

			<p>Christine Halverson is part of the research staff at IBM Research, and has written about the need for theory in CSCW.</p>

			<p>Clay Spinuzzi is an associate professor of rhetoric at The University of Texas at Austin, who has written extensively about Activity Theory in his research and on <a href="http://spinuzzi.blogspot.com">his blog</a>.</p>
