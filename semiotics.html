			<h3><a href="/">&laquo; back to HCI theory is your new bicycle</a></h3>

			<h1>HCI theory helps us understand the meaning of symbols.</h1>

			<p>Semiotic engineering extends the idea human-computer interaction is communication between the user and the designer using the interface of a program. Designers use sign like words, sounds, button, etc. and the users &ldquo;interpret&rdquo; the message by using the system.</p>

			<p>Through this communication, designers are telling users:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Who they are, what they know, what they wish or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why.</li>
				<li>What system they have built and how it works.</li>
				<li>Why and how the system improves the users&apos; lives (de Souza, 2013).</li>
			</ol>

			<p>To do this, designers must decide who the sender is, who the receiver is, what the context of communication is, what the communication code is, what the channel is, and finally, what the message is (de Souza, 2005).</p>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<p>&ldquo;An example of a well established sign is the floppy disk symbol which represents the &ldquo;save&rdquo; function in many software interfaces. This sign has persisted despite the fact that technology has evolved to a point where floppy disks are no longer common.&rdquo;</p>

			<h2>Important thinkers</h2>

			<h3>Primary thinkers</h3>
			<p>Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Peirce</p>

			<p>Clarisse Sieckenius de Souza originally proposed the idea of human-computer interaction as computer-mediated communication. The system speaks to the user through the interface created by the designer. This interaction &ndash; conversation &ndash; lets designers tell the users that they know who they are, what they need to do, how to do it, and why.</p>
