			<h1>HCI theory helps us work together using computers.</h1>

			<p>Classical McGarth theory of CSCW states that groups engage in four essential modes of operation (inception, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and execution). Each mode has  three functions: production, group well-being and member support.</p>

			<table>
				<caption>Group modes and functions (McGrath, 1991).</caption>

					<th>Production</th>
					<th>Group well-being</th>
					<th>Member support</th>

					<td>Production demand and opportunity</td>
					<td>Interaction demand and opportunity</td>

			<ul>
				<li>Inception starts when group takes a new project.</li>
				<li>Execution are the activities directly related to project goals.</li>
				<li>Problem-solving and conflict-resolution cover tangential activities that may arise along the way.</li>
				<li>Production activities focus directly on getting on with the project.</li>
				<li>Group well-being is the goal of a morale event to build empathy and trust among team members, for example.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<p>The most well known example is phenomena of social loafing. People in the group don&apos;t work as hard as when they work by themselves due to the fact that they think the outcome of their efforts are being combined.</p>

			<h2>Important thinkers</h2>

			<h3>Primary thinkers</h3>
			<p>CSCW  proposed moving away from laboratory settings of studying the groups and consider study how group operate in real world settings (Grudin, 2008). Jonathan Grudin believed that focusing exclusively on performance or productivity is prone to failure because we ignore all that happens in the groups.</p>

			<p>Kraut &ndash; CSCW has written how social psychology phenomena such as social loafing can be systematically applied to the design of group support systems such as group decision supporting tools.</p>

			<p>Lucy Suchman brought ethnography into CSCW. Qualitative research methods revealed the effects of context on social behaviors, provided deeper understanding of the means of collaboration, and offered new insights into how technology could support or disrupt collaboration.</p>

			<p>Buxton &ndash; social as a mirror.  Contributed to the artcile on  video environment, collaboration and privacy.</p>

			<h3>Secondary thinkers</h3>
			<p>B&oslash;dker &ndash; In the publication <em>From implementation to design: tailoring and the emergence of systematization in CSCW</em> apply activity theory to CSCW.Main focus is on several dimensions of the work of tailoring: construction, organizational change, learning, and politics</p>

			<p>Winograd &ndash; CSCW In the 1987 text, Understanding Computers and Cognition, Winograd and Flores developed a <em>Conversation for Action</em> where two parties attempt to coordinate action with one another regardless of whether the agents involved might be human-human, human-computer, or computer-computer.</p>
