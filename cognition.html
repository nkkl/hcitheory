			<h1>HCI theory explains how we think.</h1>

			<p><em>Cognition</em>, or the process of how we think, has been long studied by scholars in different fields. HCI has a long history with cognition; in its infancy in the 1980s, HCI researchers were optimistic about using cognitive psychology &ndash; the scientific field of how people think &ndash; to help design new computer systems that were easier to learn and use than what was currently available. The most familiar contribution of cognitive psychology to HCI is explaining &ldquo;the capabilities and limitations of users, in terms of what they can and cannot do when performing computer-based tasks&rdquo; (Rogers, 2012, p. 21). However, researchers and designers quickly found that the results that cognitive psychologists had in lab settings were not transferring to users in the real world.</p>

			<p>Another incomplete idea was <em>mental models</em>, or the assumption that users have an idea of how they system they&apos;re using works (they have a schema) and therefore know what to do next. </p>

			<p>A later approach was <em>cognitive modeling</em> &ndash; predict how users will think and design based on what the users are assumed to do. However, a problem with predictive models is they only work in isolated, predictable behavior. Once an outside influence is added &ndash; such as a co-worker that keeps bothering the user &ndash; the model is much less accurate, reducing the prediction to just a rough approximation.</p>

			<p>Newer theories focused on interactivity rather than just what happened inside a user&apos;s brain as cognitive psychology and cognitive modeling had. Rogers (2012) describes Larkin and Simon&apos;s (1997) idea of <em>external cognition</em> like this: &ldquo;While being informationally equivalent they were considered to be computationally different. That is they contain the same information about the problem but the amount of cognitive effort required to come to the solution differed&rdquo; (p. 33). In more concise terms, different objects can offload different amounts of effort from the user.</p>

			<p>Similar to external cognition, Edwin Hutchins developed a theory that focused on <em>distributed cognition</em>: cognition is not limited to one individual; rather, it is the coordination of internal thoughts, external materials, and can include other people.</p>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<h3>Cognitive psychology</h3>
			<p>Cognitive psychology has taught researchers and designers that people find it easier to recognize things shows to them rather than having to remember them. Many GUIs use this finding by designing so users only have to scan to find the item that they want rather than having to recall what command to issue (like users needed to do for DOS).</p>

			<h3>Mental models</h3>
			<p>A mental model is the view a person has in their head about how a certain technology works. Different people have different mental models. &ldquo;Appliance engineers have a deep mental model of how home entertainment systems work that allows them to work out how to set them up and fix them. In contrast, an average citizen is likely to have a reasonably good mental model of how to operate their home entertainment system but a shallow mental model of how it works&rdquo; (Rogers, 2012, p. 27).</p>

			<h3>External cognition</h3>
			<p>External cognition is similar to cognitive psychology in that they also suggest have some things always visible in an application vs. having to know (internalize) other aspects. They say that knowledge resides both &ldquo;in the head&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the world&rdquo;.</p>

			<h3>Distributed cognition</h3>
			<p>An example of distributed cognition at work is the world of air traffic controllers. The controllers themselves have knowledge about how the airspace looks and when to tell airplanes to change their speed, altitude, or direction &ndash; these decisions are made by the controller in their head. However, they have tools to help them with the task &ndash; their system helps project the trajectory of the airplane by taking wind speed, aircraft performance, etc. Using this information, the controller can make a more educated instruction (Halverson, 1994).</p>

			<h2>Important thinkers</h2>

			<h3>Primary thinkers</h3>
			<p><em>Cognitive psychology</em>: Norman, Preece, Monk</p>

			<p><em>Cognitive modeling</em>: Shneiderman, Hutchins, Norman</p>

			<p>Herbert Simon and Allen Newell developed a hypothesis that humans manipulate symbols the same way as computers. This association lets designers determine the optimal interface by understanding the users psychology and present different problems in different ways to provide more value to the user.</p>

			<p>Rogers et al. analyzed mental models in their book <em>Models in the Mind: Theory, Perspective and Application</em>. However, they, and many others, found that it was hard to prove mental models existed and performed the way researchers assumed they would.</p>

			<p>In their 2000 paper, Hollan, Hutchins and Kirsch argue that distributed cognition should be the &ldquo;new foundation for human-computer interaction&rdquo; (p. 174). There are three types of distribution of cognitive processes &ndash; distributed across multiple people, coordination between internal and external materials, and distributed over time so past events change future events. By understanding these processes, designers can be more effective in how they design human-computer interactions.</p>

			<h3>Secondary thinkers</h3>

			<p>Bill Buxton, computer scientist, designer, and pioneer of HCI, named cognition as one of the mirrors for evaluating how design reflects human traits. &ldquo;[...] we should consider technology in terms of the fidelity with which it reflects human capabilities [...] cognitive: how we think, learn, solve problems and what cognitive skills we possess [...]&rdquo; (1994, p.2). He says that one of the biggest successes of the personal computer is a spreadsheet (i.e. Excel) because it &ldquo;fits&rdquo; the way people think about certain problems and helps them organize information in a way that makes it more understandable.</p>
