			<h3><a href="/">&laquo; back to HCI theory is your new bicycle</a></h3>

			<h1>HCI theory helps us clarify our relationship with technology.</h1>

			<p>Actor-Network Theory, or ANT, takes the approach of describing both humans and non-humans (such as computers) as “equal actors, tied together into networks built and maintained in order to achieve a particular goal, for example the development of a product” <a href="references.html"> (Abrahamsen, Chen, Feng, & Manohar, 2013)</a>, also known as giving “agency” to both humans non-humans. With this, it provides a framework and systematic way to consider the infrastructure surrounding technological achievements. There are five key concepts of Actor-Network Theory:</p>

			<p><em>Actors</em> are all &ldquo;entities that do things&rdquo; <a href="references.html"(Latour, 1992)</a>. Actors can be human and non-human, with no distinction being made between them.</p>

			<p>A <em>black box</em> is a collection of entities (can be actors or networks or both) that is considered stable and the details of which need no longer be considered.</p>

			<p>A <em>network</em> is a group of unspecified relationships between entities (actors). Actors and networks are mutually constitutive.</p>

			<p>Properties of a setting that make certain things possible and others impossible are called <em>prescriptions</em>.</p>

			<p>An <em>intermediary</em> is the link that connects actors to networks and defines the network itself. Actors circulate intermediaries between themselves to form networks.</p>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<p>Rather than saying Newton “founded” the theory of gravitation seemingly as though he were alone in a vacuum, Actor-Network Theory emphasizes and considers all surrounding factors — no one acts alone. Newton’s past experiences, his colleagues, his connections, his use of Euclidean geometry, Kepler’s astronomy, Galileo’s mechanics, his tools, the details of his lab, cultural factors and restrictions placed upon him in his environment, and various other technical and non-technical elements would all be described and considered in his actor-network.</p>

			<h2>Important thinkers</h2>
			
			<h3>Primary thinkers</h3>
		
			<p>One of the developers of ANT, <i>Bruno Latour</i> is a French sociologist, anthropologist,theorist in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and currently Professor at Sciences Po Paris. His more theoretical books include “Science in Action”, “Pandora's Hope”, and perhaps his most popular work, “We Have Never Been Modern”. Latour has pioneered an approach to socio-cultural analysis built on the notion that social life arises in complex networks of actants – people, things, ideas, norms, technologies, and so on – influencing each other in dynamic ways. “He is a prolific writer and has written over fifteen books and published over 120 articles.” <a href="references.html"> (Abrahamsen, Chen, Feng, & Manohar, 2013)</a></p>
	
			<p>One of the most influential works of <i>John Law</i> is in Actor-Network Theory (ANT), developed with STS scholars Michel Callon and Bruno Latour. Currently, Law is a Professor of Sociology at the Open University in the U.K. and director of the Centre for Research and Socio-Cultural Change (CRESC) at the University of Manchester.</p>
			
			<h3>Secondary thinkers</h3>
			
			<p><i>Susan Leigh Star</i> was a pioneer in the study of organizing information. Much of her work was guided by interests in both technology and feminism. She is best known for developing the concept of boundary objects and invisible work, but also contributed significant work to Actor-Network Theory. Her paper, “How things (actor-net)work: Classification, magic and the ubiquity of standards”, for example, examines the practice of black-boxing objects as a form of magic. Star passed away unexpectedly on March 24, 2010. <a href="references.html">(Fresenius, Goist, Panth, &amp; Sharma, 2013; Bowker &amp; Star, 1996)</a></p>
