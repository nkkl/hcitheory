			<h1>HCI theory helps us clarify our relationship with technology.</h1>

			<p>The theory&apos;s aim is to describe a society of humans and nonhumans as equal actors tied together into networks built and maintained in order to achieve a particular goal, for example the development of a product.</p>

			<p><em>Actors</em> are all &ldquo;entities that do things&rdquo; (Latour, 1992). Actors can be human and non-human, with no distinction being made between them.</p>

			<p>A <em>black box</em> is a collection of entities (can be actors or networks or both) that is considered stable and the details of which need no longer be considered.</p>

			<p>A <em>network</em> is a group of unspecified relationships between entities (actors). Actors and networks are mutually constitutive.</p>

			<p>Properties of a setting that make certain things possible and others impossible are called <em>prescriptions</em>.</p>

			<p>An <em>intermediary</em> is the link that connects actors to networks and defines the network itself. Actors circulate intermediaries between themselves to form networks.</p>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<p>Rather than saying Newton &ldquo;founded&rdquo; the theory of gravitation seemingly as though he were alone in a vacuum, Actor-Network Theory emphasizes and considers all surrounding factors &ndash; no one acts alone. Newton&apos;s past experiences, his colleagues, his connections ,his use of Euclidean geometry, Kepler&apos;s astronomy, Galileo&apos;s mechanics, his tools, the details of his lab, cultural factors and restrictions placed upon him in his environment, and various other technical and non-technical elements would all be described and considered in his actor-network.</p>
