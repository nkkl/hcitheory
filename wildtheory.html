			<h3><a href="/">&laquo; back to HCI theory is your new bicycle</a></h3>

			<h1>HCI theory helps us look outside conventional thinking.</h1>

			<p>A central part of designing in the wild is evaluating prototypes as they are really used and integrated within people’s lives. This involves observing and recording what people do and how this changes over suitable periods of time. Whereas the burning question in HCI used to be “how many participants do I need?” the hotly debated question now is “how long should my study run for?” Some say a few weeks, others argue for months while some even suggest years are needed to show sustainable and long-term effects.</p>

			<p>The outcome of conducting in the wild studies can be most revealing, demonstrating quite different results from those arising out of lab studies. Crucially, people’s motivation for participating varies – it is one thing for someone to volunteer for a short-term experiment but quite another for them to integrate a novel technology into their life in order to change their behavior.</p>

			<p>Early studies revealed how new devices and services are actually appropriated rather than whether they match usability or criteria. But they are expensive to run and expectations are high as to what an in the wild longitudinal study should entail. There are many questions that need to be addressed, to explore the extent we are equipped to do in the wild research.</p>

			<p>“The community needs to address and manage concerns relating to the extent to which HCI can invade people’s lives in the pursuit of research goals. Are we legitimizing areas that have been either taboo and/or considered outside the remit of HCI (such as sex and religion)? Are we equipped to address these new topics with the right tools, sensibilities and level of professionalism?” (Rogers)</p>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<p>“DiasNet Mobile” is a mobile service for personalized diabetes management. It allows the user to manage daily diabetes related information and incorporates feedback from a server-based expert system. The final evalution of this system was done “in the wild”, using a three month field trial, and was built as a result of an iterative user-centered design process.</p>

			<h2>Important thinkers</h2>

			<p>Along with his work in Cognition, the personal mantra of <i>Bill Buxton</i> clearly reflects his connection to in-the- wild approach: “Ultimately, we are deluding ourselves if we think that the products that we design are the "things" that we sell, rather than the individual, social and cultural experience that they engender, and the value and impact that they have. Design that ignores this is not worthy of the name.” (Souce: http://billbuxton.com)</p>

			<p>The major focus of <i>Yvonne Rogers</i> is on augmenting and extending everyday learning and work activities with novel technologies. This involves design via  diversity of technologies, including mobile, wireless, handheld and pervasive computing. She is currently a Professor of Interaction Design and director of UCLIC at UCL.</p>
