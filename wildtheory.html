			<h3><a href="/">&laquo; back to HCI theory is your new bicycle</a></h3>

			<h1>HCI theory helps us look outside conventional thinking.</h1>

			<p>A central part of designing in the wild is evaluating prototypes as they are really used and integrated within people&apos;s lives. This involves observing and recording what people do and how this changes over suitable periods of time. Whereas the burning question in HCI used to be &ldquo;how many participants do I need?&rdquo; the hotly debated question now is &ldquo;how long should my study run for?&rdquo; Some say a few weeks, others argue for months while some even suggest years are needed to show sustainable and long-term effects.</p>

			<p>The outcome of conducting in the wild studies can be most revealing, demonstrating quite different results from those arising out of lab studies. Crucially, people&apos;s motivation for participating varies &ndash; it is one thing for someone to volunteer for a short-term experiment but quite another for them to integrate a novel technology into their life in order to change their behaviour.</p>

			<p>Early studies revealed how new devices and services are actually appropriated rather than whether they match usability or criteria. But they are expensive to run and expectations are high as to what an in the wild longitudinal study should entail. There are many questions that need to be addressed, to explore the extent we are equipped to do in the wild research.</p>

			<p>Rogers says that &ldquo;The community needs to address and manage concerns relating to the extent to which HCI can invade people&apos;s lives in the pursuit of research goals. Are we legitimizing areas that have been either taboo and/or considered outside the remit of HCI (e.g., sex, religion, porn)? Are we equipped to address these new topics with the right tools, sensibilities and level of professionalism?&rdquo;</p>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<p>DiasNet Mobile A mobile service for personalized diabetes management and advisory. It allows the user to manage daily diabetes related information and incorporates feedback from a server-based expert system that models the blood glucose metabolism of individual users and feeds back information about past and future blood sugar levels. The system was built as a result of an iterative user-centered design process and the final evaluation was a three months field trial.</p>
