			<h1>HCI theory helps us understand how people work in groups.</h1>

			<p>Social psychology has &ldquo;developed a rich theoretical base for understanding and predicting group behavior.&rdquo; And while &ldquo;there is no unified theory in modern American social psychology with pretensions of explaining all social behavior&rdquo;, there are &ldquo;a large number of medium-level theories, each attempting to account for an interesting social phenomenon in a limited domain. An example of such a medium-level theory is the result that &ldquo;groups on average perform better than the average of their members or than a member selected at random. For example, they produce more and better ideas than a single individual when brainstorming, and they solve problems more accurately than the typical person in the group.&rdquo; This is the result of a social pyschology phenomenon known as &ldquo;social loafing&rdquo;, which tells us that &ldquo;individuals typically work less hard when they are part of a group than when they are working on their own.&rdquo;</p>

			<h2>For example</h2>

			<p>Online communities, such as Reddit, Digg, and Yahoo! Groups, &ldquo;depend upon the commitment and voluntary participation of their members.&rdquo; As such, community design is &ldquo;critical&rdquo; in this regard. Using social psychology&apos;s Common Identity Theory, we can &ldquo;make predictions about the causes and consequences of people&apos;s attachment to individual group members.&rdquo; This can show us that &ldquo;design decisions, such as those focused on recruiting newcomers versus retaining exist- ing members, constraining or promoting off-topic discussion, and limiting group size or allowing uncontrolled growth, can lead to common identity or interpersonal bonds among community members, and consequently to different levels and forms of community participation by those so motivated.&rdquo;<a href="references.html">(Kraut, 2003)</a></p>

			<h2>Important thinkers</h2>

			<h3>Primary thinkers</h3>
			<p>Robert Kraut is an American social psychologist who has studied online communities and ways to apply social psychology theories to their design. He is currently a professor at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

			<p>Sherry Turkle&apos;s research is focused on psychoanalysis and human-technology interaction, including what it means to be alive, the notion of reality, the ability to turn on different parts of the mind and highlight the best parts of one&apos;s identity. Turkle is currently the Abby Rockefeller Mauz&eacute; Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
